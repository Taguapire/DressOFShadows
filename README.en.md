# DressOfShadows 🕶️🔐

*A tool that encrypts words as if they were secrets wrapped in shadows.*

**DressOfShadows** is an application developed in **C#** using **UWP (Universal Windows Platform)**. It was originally conceived as a proof of concept to explore the publishing process in the **Microsoft Store**, but it evolved into a minimalist and effective tool for applied cryptography.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 Symmetric encryption and decryption of plain text
- 📦 Supported algorithms:
  - **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  - **Blowfish**
  - **Rijndael**
  - **Twofish**
- 🧪 Cryptographic library: **BouncyCastle** (.NET)

## 🧠 Motivation

In a world where data flows carelessly, *DressOfShadows* offers a simple defense: to wrap information in a mathematical veil, as if every message concealed intent.

The integration of [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org) with C# provides a robust and highly compatible cryptographic solution.

Inspired by the narrative spirit of *Stephenson* and *Gibson*, this app encrypts not only text—but also context.
